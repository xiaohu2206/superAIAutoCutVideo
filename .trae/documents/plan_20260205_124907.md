I have finalized the design checklist in `.trae/document/fun_asr_design.md` incorporating all your feedback.

**Finalized Design:**
1.  **Corrected Language Support**: Updated the model registry to use the full language names (e.g., "中文", "粤语", "日文") as specified in the official documentation and your example.
2.  **Embedded Reference Code**: Added the provided Python code snippet directly into the design document to serve as the standard implementation reference for the service layer.
3.  **Complete Integration Plan**: The document covers the full backend lifecycle:
    *   **Model Management**: Download (ModelScope/HF), validation, and path handling for Nano and MLT-Nano models.
    *   **Service Layer**: Encapsulation of `funasr.AutoModel` with VAD support (`fsmn-vad`) for handling long audio.
    *   **API Routes**: Endpoints for model status, download progress (WebSocket), and testing.
    *   **Project Integration**: Logic to switch between `bcut` and `fun_asr` providers in the subtitle extraction workflow.

The design document is ready for review.
